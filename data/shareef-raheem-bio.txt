Hello, my name is Shareef Raheem and I am a freshman BSCS (Bachelor in Science of Computer Science) at the DigiPen Institute of Technology. My goal after graduating is to work at Google as a Software Developer in hopes of advancing technology paving the future. The software can be text-based games or even a speech-to-text engine.

Before moving to Washington I lived in Florida for five years, but I have moved around a lot throughout my life. I have always had a strong interest in technology namely the new ways software is advancing to help create an easier life for people. Starting with simple game projects when I was younger gave me early exposure to content creation. Making really simple games and some utilities in Adobe Flash CS3 back in 2009. My focus was typically graphics later developing into photography and image manipulation within recent times.

If you have any questions or concerns contact me. I enjoy working with people on projects and gaining knowledge along the way. All my contact information is on the contact page. I'm open to teaching and learning in anyway I can.

The subject area is image processing with a specific focus on photography. 
That includes image processing can help computers identify objects much like humans, such as recognizing faces. 
This is heavily connected with the fields of A.I. and the use of someone’s face as a form of ID (what the iPhone 8 is rumored to replace ‘TouchID’ with). 
We got here starting with a new type of camera, using digital sensors rather than film.

I’ve had a recent interest in photography as it’s a nice way to capture the natural world while telling a story. 
I appreciate that it is a break from my more professional ambitions although when I feel the need I try to connect it through the field of image processing.

I am interested in learning the different techniques in which images can be manipulated and used for the betterment of our society, maybe even learning how to edit photos use these techniques.
I have a few months experience with photography and I have been reading on how to manipulate images for certain effects because I wanted to make a mini-photoshop as a software project.
In the technological world there is almost always a debate in what is the most efficient way to perform a certain action. Computer scientists find different methods to do something but there are always tradeoffs. The different methods of resizing an image are a great example of this (e.g nearest-neighbor, natural-neighbor, bilinear).

The larger issues get into how do we effectively use the information gotten from images and what is the best way to compress them based on the task at hand. For facial identification you should use a bilinear form of resizing. To have a good user experience you need to make sure the technology works, not just works but works quick.
