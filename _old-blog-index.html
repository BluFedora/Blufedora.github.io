      The subject area is image processing with a specific focus on photography. That includes image processing can help computers identify objects much like humans, such as recognizing faces. This is heavily connected with the fields of A.I. and the use of someone’s face as a form of ID (what the iPhone 8 is rumored to replace ‘TouchID’ with). We got here starting with a new type of camera, using digital sensors rather than film.

      <p>
I’ve had a recent interest in photography as it’s a nice way to capture the natural world while telling a story. I appreciate that it is a break from my more professional ambitions although when I feel the need I try to connect it through the field of image processing.
      </p>
  <p>
I am interested in learning the different techniques in which images can be manipulated and used for the betterment of our society, maybe even learning how to edit photos use these techniques.
I have a few months experience with photography and I have been reading on how to manipulate images for certain effects because I wanted to make a mini-photoshop as a software project.
In the technological world there is almost always a debate in what is the most efficient way to perform a certain action. Computer scientists find different methods to do something but there are always tradeoffs. The different methods of resizing an image are a great example of this (e.g nearest-neighbor, natural-neighbor, bilinear).
      </p>
      <p>
The larger issues get into how do we effectively use the information gotten from images and what is the best way to compress them based on the task at hand. For facial identification you should use a bilinear form of resizing. To have a good user experience you need to make sure the technology works, not just works but works quick.
