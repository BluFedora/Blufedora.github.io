        <p>
          Digital image processing is integrated into many parts of our modern life.
          Many smart phones today come with a fingerprint scanner standard.
          This biometric form of authentication improved to be become much faster and more accurate since its début (on mobile phones) on the “Toshiba G500” (2007). Even some new computers such as the 2016 and 2017 Apple
MacBook Pros use this biometric form of identification. Recent versions of Android and the Apple iPhone X support facial identification as a way to secure your device. Low light performance of facial identification currently is very poor but supposedly Apple has found a solution to this problem. Using infrared cameras and projecting dots on the subject’s face is supposedly going to solve the problem but we cannot do usability tests until the phone is released.

        <h4>Cutting Edge:  </h4>

        <p>
          The new Google Lens project will make it so “your smartphone camera won’t just see what you see, but will also understand what you see to help you take action.” (Google, via Twitter, https://twitter.com/Google/status/864891667723300864) This is an amazing step towards a fully automated life. Google photos can now detect faces from all of your photos and categorize based on who is in the photo. In my experience the feature has been eerily accurate but at times useful for organization.

        <h4>What’s at stake and why it matters?  </h4>

        <p>
          As technology advances in regards to imaging, our ways of interacting with the world around us changes.
          There is less need for manually analyzing pictures to find an object or putting in alphanumeric passwords.
          Image processing at its core is automation of the many tasks humans do with their visual system.
          This technology helps improve quality of life and makes it so that many trivial activities are done just from a simple facial expression.
          The problem now becomes if we do use this form of biometrics for security, then this method of authentication must be as precise as possible.
          According to Apple, “[w]ith Touch ID, it stated that there was a 1 in 50,000 chance that someone would be able to open your phone with their fingerprint.
          These numbers were a little better for Face ID, at 1 in 1,000,000,” (Casserly) this is a dramatic increase in security and this technology will only get more accurate with time.
