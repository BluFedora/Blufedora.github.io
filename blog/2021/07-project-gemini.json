The animations work through the use of a virtual timeline that allows for animating any value made up of floats such as Vector2f(s) for positioning and sizing. Text is from a bitmap atlas created offline along with a file describing some kerning information. These files at runtime are loaded and parsed to be used by the text renderer. Text is just a bunch of quads with the correct UV  corresponding to the character that you want drawn. The UI supports Mouse, Keyboard, and Joystick controls and will switch automatically depending on which device was last used."
