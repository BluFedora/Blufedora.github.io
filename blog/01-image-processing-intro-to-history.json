        "This data needs to be interpreted in such a way to allow computers to have a high-level understanding of what the image or video represents. ",

        "The term ‘image,’ which is traditionally thought of as a picture or grid of pixels, can exist in many forms. ",
        "An image can be collected from various methods such as bouncing radio or ultrasonic waves. ",
        "The many mediums to project the world onto allow for different representations of the data so that depending on the aspect we want to focus on it is easy to see. ",
        "Take the case of the way we use x-rays to see if there is a fracture in someone’s bones, that image is not very useful when trying to create a fingerprint scanner. ",
        "Fortunately to mitigate this problem “[t]here is an amazing availability of radiation to be sensed, recorded as images, and viewed, analyzed, transmitted, or stored.” (Bovik)"

        "Development of computer vision picked up in the late 1960s at universities in an attempt to advance artificial intelligence (A.I). ",
        "The idea was for analyzing images to act as a steppingstone for more intelligent robots that could make context aware decisions. ",
        "Based on that idea, some projects were just attaching a camera to a computer and having it ‘describe what it saw’.",
        "In the eary stage of image processing there was a heavy separation between image processing and computer vision. While computer vision wanting extract three dimensional representations of a scene from the collected data. ",
        " In the late 1990s computer vision started to merge with computer graphics (image based rendering, image morphing, light-field rendering). ",
        "Modern research of computer vision incorporate machine learning techniques (which is somewhat out of the scope of this blog) for more precise interpretations of this world."

        "Algorithms for these effects are getting very efficient to where we can update millions (1920 x 1080) of pixels sixty or more times a second while performing hundreds of other tasks. All video games use image processing concepts at some level, although it may be difficult to tell since there are sometimes many levels of abstraction from what is actually happening with the hardware. ",
        "The graphics are drawn to something called a frame buffer which is a grid / array of pixels holding the data of what’s currently onscreen. ",

        "After all the shaders have run the GPU draws all these pixels to the screen through a process called ‘rasterization’."
