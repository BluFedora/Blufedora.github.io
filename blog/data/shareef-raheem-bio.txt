Hello, my name is Shareef Raheem and I am a freshman BSCS (Bachelor in Science of Computer Science) at the DigiPen Institute of Technology. My goal after graduating is to work at Google as a Software Developer in hopes of advancing technology paving the future. The software can be text-based games or even a speech-to-text engine.

Before moving to Washington I lived in Florida for five years, but I have moved around a lot throughout my life. I have always had a strong interest in technology namely the new ways software is advancing to help create an easier life for people. Starting with simple game projects when I was younger gave me early exposure to content creation. Making really simple games and some utilities in Adobe Flash CS3 back in 2009. My focus was typically graphics later developing into photography and image manipulation within recent times.

If you have any questions or concerns contact me. I enjoy working with people on projects and gaining knowledge along the way. All my contact information is on the contact page. I'm open to teaching and learning in anyway I can.
