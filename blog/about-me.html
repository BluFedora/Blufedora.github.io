My goal after graduating is to work at Google as a Software Developer in hopes of advancing technology paving the future. The software can be text-based games or even a speech-to-text engine.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Before moving to Washington I lived in Florida for five years, but I have moved around a lot throughout my life. I have always had a strong interest in technology, namely the new ways software is advancing to help create an easier life for people. Starting with simple game projects when I was younger gave me early exposure to content creation. I made really simple games and some utilities in Adobe Flash CS3 back in 2009. My focus was typically graphics, then later turning to photography and more recently image manipulation.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">If you have any questions or concerns contact me. I enjoy working with people on projects and gaining knowledge along the way. All my contact information is on the contact page. I'm open to teaching and learning in anyway I can.</p>
