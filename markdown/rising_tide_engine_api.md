# Overview
  > This document describes the API design of the Engine as a whole not on any specifics.
  > Typically you will need to add more functionality than what is described here but this is the baseline so that all engine Modules can interact with each-other in a sane way.
  > The member variables on any class is a suggestion while the __member functions are a requirement__.
  > If you are contributing to the Engine layer of this project you must follow the [Style Guide](rising_tide_style_guide_2018.pdf)

# Asset IO
  - The Asset System uses a reference count based system so that assets can be unloaded a reloaded pretty gracefully.
  - Everything is handed out through an [AssetHandle][] that can be used exactly the same as a pointer to the specified resoruce.

## TileMap (class)
  - This class represents a grid of tiles that makes up an [Area][] graphically.


## Area (class)
  - This is our main "Level" representation and what the Mjolnir Editor is designed to help create. It contains a list of all the active entities and components and is what is save to disk.

  - Member Functions
    - ``` TileMap&  tilemap();                                                  ```
    - ``` bool      load(const String& path);                                   ```
    - ``` bool      save(const String& path);                                   ```
      - Save only _really_ needs to be implemented in the editor side most-likely but maybe this function is used for player save data?
    - ``` void      pushBackgroundTrack(AudioStream& track);                    ```
    - ``` void      crossFadeTrack(unsigned old_track, AudioStream& new_track);  ```
    - ``` void      popBackgroundTrack();                                       ```

## File (class)
  - This is a utility wrapper around the "std::iostream" object allowing for finer control / utilities for writing out binary files in an Endian independent manner.

## Assets (class)
  - The [Files](#file-class) have to come from somewhere so this class just manages the memory associated with Files. There should be a maximum of 16 Files opened at once.
  - This class also manages the memory associated with [Resources][Resource] and makes sure a certain texture, or sound is only loaded once.
  - All assets are referencce count thus unloaded when nothign references that asset, but if requested the engine will attempt to load it on demand.

  - Member Functions
    - ``` File*           makeFile(const String& path);                                               ```
    - ``` Texture2D*      makeTexture(const String& name, std::uint32_t width, std::uint32_t height); ```
    - ``` Texture2D*      loadTexture(const String& path);                                            ```
    - ``` RenderMaterial* makeMaterial(const String& name);                                           ```
    - ``` RenderMaterial* loadMaterial(const String& path);                                           ```
    - ... pretty much the same pattern for the rest of the [Resources][Resource] types ...

## JsonParser (class)
  - The good old Json Parser. This class allows us to write out and read in Json formatted text documents for save data and other configuration.

## JsonValue (class)
  - This class is specialized variant that contains:
    - HashMap&lt;String, JsonValue&gt;
    - Vector&lt;JsonValue&gt;
    - double
    - String
    - bool

## AssetHandle (class)
 - This class is a tagged union that will contain the data to various assets used by each respective subsystem.
  - [AnimationSet](#animationset-class)      <- [Animation](#animation)
  - [Texture2D](#texture2d-class)            <- [Graphics](#graphics)
  - [AudioStream](#audiostream-class)        <- [Audio][]
  - [AudioSoundFx](#audiosoundfx-class)      <- [Audio][]
  - [Font]()                                 <- [User Interface](#user-interface)
  - [Script]()                               <- [Scripting](#scripting)
  - [RenderMaterial][]                       <- [Graphics](#graphics)

# Animation
  - This module is a very simple Sprite / Frame based animation framework. It supports variable times frames.
  - *(v1.1.5):* Now contains an easing module to help with more procedurally generated animations.

## AnimationFrame (class)
  - Just a pairing of an index and how long the frame should last.

## Animation (typedef)
  - Just a simple list of [animation frames](#animationframe-class).
  - Vector&lt;AnimationFrame&gt;

## AnimationSet (class)

  - This class contains a list of [animations](#animation-typedef) associated with a certain [texture](#texture2d-class).
  - The data needed are:
    - The UV [rectangles](#rect2f-typedef) of the each frame.
    - The order of the [frames](#animationframe-class) for each animation. (Probably contained in a map)

## AnimationComponent (class)
  - This is the class actually used as a component for the [ECS](#ecs) module. It represents an actual instance of an animation while sharing the  important data that is not directly related to each particular entity.

  - The data needed are:
    - The shared [Animation Set](#animation-set-class) data.
    - The current animation that is wanting to be played.
    - The current index of the animation to be used.
    - The current time left for the current frame.

## Ease&lt;T&gt; (class)
  - T value() const;
  - T update();

---

# Artificial Intelligence
  - This module is for giving some external structure to the [behavior system](#behavior-class) as to reduce code duplications.
  - The bulk of the system comes from making specific [nodes](#iactionnode-class) for the type of game we're making so the engine backend is _very_ light with only two classes in this specification.

## IActionNode (class)
  - This class is a single unit of state update that an object would undergo.
  - These are contained in an [ActionList][] to compose more conplex behaviors by aggregating together a string of nodes.
    - EX: 'Move', 'WaitNSeconds', 'FollowPlayer', 'FindPath', 'PlaySound'

## ActionList (class)
  - This class is a 'pre-compiled' list of [nodes](#iactionnode-class) that are ran in the same order every time.
  - If you want an [entity](#entity-class) to change its set of actions it takes then just multiple [action lists](#actionlist-class) and switch which one is currently the active one.
    - EX: Have an [action list](#actionlist-class) for each stage of a boss battle.

---

# Audio
  - This is a simple module that is a simple wrapper around [FMOD](#dependencies) to provide audio output to our engine.
  - This may be replaced by a custom audio engine at some point but is not a proprity.

## AudioInfo (class)
  - This class has public members for creating an an [AudioStream](#audiostream-class) or [AudioSoundFx](#audiosoundfx-class) from memory.

## AudioStream (class)
  - This class is made for cases where larger audio files such as background music as the file is streamed from the hard-drive rather than having it loaded completely into ram.

  - Member Functions
    - ``` void play(unsigned int start_pos_in_ms); ```
    - ``` void stop(); // Cuts the music immediately ```
    - ``` void setVolume(float value); ```
    - ``` bool loadFromFile(const String& path); ```
    - ``` bool loadFromData(const AudioInfo& data); ```

## AudioSoundFx (class)
  - This class is for smaller sound effect sounds that can be easily kept in memory and is very short lived.

  - Member Functions
    - ``` void play(); ```
    - ``` void randomizePitch(); ```
      - Allows the sound to be played at random pitches.
    - ``` void randomizeGain(); ```
      - Allows the sound to be played at random volumes.
    - ``` void makeInteresting(); ```
      - Calls 'randomizePitch' and 'randomizeGain'.
    - ``` bool loadFromData(const AudioInfo& data); ```
    - ``` void setVolume(float value); ```
    - ``` void matchToTrack(const AudioStream& track); ```
    - ``` void addReverb(int amount); ```

## audio_manip (namespace)

  - This namespace has functions that are shared between [streams](#audiostream-class) and [soundfx](#audiosoundfx-class)
  ```cpp
    // Handles fading the audio in or out depending on the parameters.
  template<typename T>
  void fade(T&           audio_source,
            unsigned int fade_time_in_ms,
            float        start_volume,
            float        end_volume,
            unsigned int start_pos);

  template<typename T>
  void fade_volume(T&           audio_source,
                   unsigned int fade_time_in_ms,
                   float        start_volume,
                   float        end_volume);

    // Adds a “tape stop” effect to the music, which essentially pitches the song down
    // and fades out at the same time.
    // Use this when player dies?
  template<typename T>
  void tape_stop(T&           audio_source,
                 unsigned int fade_time_in_ms);

  template<typename T>
  T low_pass(T& audio_source, int frequency);

  template<typename T>
  T high_pass(T& audio_source, int frequency);
  ```

### API Example

```cpp
  // NOTE: This will enqueue an Ease into the current Area to be updated by the EasingSystem.
audio_manip::fade<AudioStream>(engine.currentArea()->backgroundTracks().at(1),
                                  500,  // 0.5s
                                  0.0f, // completely muted
                                  1.0f, // full volume
                                  0     // 0.0s
                                 );

```

# Core
  - This is a basic module consolidates all the [other modules of the engine](#engine-sub-systems) together and helps coordinate a cohesive result.
  - It also contains the GameState Manager along with the definition of a Game State.
    - The gamestates are organized as a stack with a push and pop interface.
    - A gamestate can decide if it wants to propagate events down to the lower gamestates by just blocking the event or not.
      - EX: This allows for a very flexible design by maybe for an in-game editor that can be enabled or disabled by just pushing a new editor gamestate onto the stack.

## Engine (class)
  - The Engine class serves 3 main purposes:
    - This class is what's instantiated from main when the program started up. It's job is to coordinate all the subsystems and making sure everything gets called in the correct order.
    - This class manages the [IGameState](#igamestate-interface) stack and makes sure to call all the necessary virtual methods on the [gamestate](#igamestate-interface) to make sure restarting works correctly.
    - This class also manages the the total memory used the the application as a whole.

## IGameState (interface)
  - This is an interface for what makes a game state. It provides some utilities for manipulating the gamestate stack.

---

# Data Structures

## Vector (typedef)
  - std::vector&lt;T&gt;

## HashTable (class)
  - This data-strucuture is for storing key-value mappings can be used in an almost identical way as "std::unnordered_map".
  - This is implemented using an open-addressing, linear probing technique.

## ForwardLinkedList (typedef)
  - std::forward_list&lt;T&gt;

## String (typedef)
  - std::string

## Variant (class)
  - This class represents a tagged union of a limited set of values you specify.
  - An example of the use is the [MaterialVariable](#materialvariable-typedef) typedef.
  - The size of this class is the sizeof the largest class type in the template argument list + sizeof(std::size_t).

## Any (class)
  - This class is similar to [Variant](#variant-class) except it can hold any value. This comes at a performance cost (dynamic memory allocation + virtual function call overhead) so [Variant](#variant-class) is prefered.
  - The size of this class is the sizeof(void*) + sizeof(void*). (This is because it used dynamic memory allocation to support any type)

## SparseArray (class)
  - The SparseArray is used for fast addition and removal of elements while keeping a cache coherent array of objects.
  - Made for faster (frequent) Insert(s) and Remove(s) relative to [Vector](#vector-typedef) while keeping a cache coherent dense array.

---

# ECS

## Entity (class)
  - This is the GameObject representation of the Engine that contains [handles](#handlet-class) to each of it's components.
  - All Entities are owned by a parent [Area][] along with it's component data.

## Behavior (class)
  -

---

# Graphics
- The Graphics backend we will be uisng is OpenGL 3.2.
- The Graphics Module will be largely based off of the concept of materials that contain whole pipeline states for easy batch management.
- The Renderer should be separated into 3 Layers of abstraction the highest layer being what the rest of the Modules will be interfacting with.
  - [High Level](#high-level-graphics)
    - Will contain code that will be used to interface with the Graphics Module from other Engine Modules.
    - This layer will be the most abstracted from the hardware and will use concepts such as [Sprites](#sprite-class) and [Materials](#material-class).
  - [Mid Level](#mid-level-graphics)
    - Will contain code that will make it easier for the graphics programmers to work on adding new functionality to the engine.
    - This layer is based off of the concept of [DrawItems](#drawitem-api-example)  and this is where we do all of the culling and sorting.
  - [Low Level](#low-level-graphics)
    - Will contain code that is just a thin wrapper around the underlying graphics API (OpenGL, DirectX, etc...) that we will be using.
    - This layer manages the GPU memory making sure everything is layed out in a way so that efficient rendering is possible.

## High Level Graphics

### BlendMode (enum class)
- These are the Blendmodes the Engine will support. 'NONE' is an optimization since blending takes GPU cycles otherwise a normal 'ALPHA_BLENDING' works. 'ADDITIVE_BLENDING' is typically used for the way lights will be applies to the scene.

  - ``` NONE              ```
  - ``` ALPHA_BLENDING    ```
  - ``` ADDITIVE_BLENDING ```

### DrawMode (enum class)
- Supporting all the DrawModes because it's such a trivial feature to have and may be useful for debug drawing type contexts.

  - ``` POINT_LIST      (GL_POINTS) ```
  - ``` LINE_LIST       (GL_LINES) ```
  - ``` LINE_STRIP      (GL_LINE_STRIP) ```
  - ``` LINE_LOOP       (GL_LINE_LOOP) ```
  - ``` TRIANGLE_LIST   (GL_TRIANGLES) ```
  - ``` TRIANGLE_STRIP  (GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP) ```
  - ``` TRIANGLE_FAN    (GL_TRIANGLE_FAN) ```

### MaterialVariable (typedef)
  - Variant&lt;bool, float, int, Vec2, Vec3, Vec4, Mat2x2, Mat3x3, Mat4x4, std::pair&lt;int, Texture2D*&gt;&gt;

### RenderMaterial (class)
  - The material class contains the WHOLE pipeline state of the renderer, this makes sorting for batch rendering super easy as you just have to sort based of the pointers of the material each [DrawItem](#drawitem-api-example) has.

  - Member Functions
    - ``` BlendMode        setBlendMode(BlendMode mode);              ```
    - ``` DrawMode         setDrawMode(DrawMode mode);                ```
    - ``` MaterialVariable value(const char* value_name);             ```
    - ``` void             setValue(const char* value_name, T value); ```
    - ``` Shader*          shader(void);                              ```
    - ``` void             setShader(Shader* shader);                 ```

### Color (class)
  - A Color is used in the Vertex class. It takes up only four bytes for all channel together by making use of bit shifts and masks for a very efficient memory layout. This is much better than using four floats as the representation of colors (although we do lose some precision but all the color depth that matters comes from textures anyway).

  - Member Variables
    - ``` std::uint8_t m_R; ```
    - ``` std::uint8_t m_G; ```
    - ``` std::uint8_t m_B; ```
    - ``` std::uint8_t m_A; ```

  - Member Functions
    - ``` std::uint8_t r() const; ```
    - ``` std::uint8_t g() const; ```
    - ``` std::uint8_t b() const; ```
    - ``` std::uint8_t a() const; ```
    - ``` void         setR(const std::uint8_t value); ```
    - ``` void         setG(const std::uint8_t value); ```
    - ``` void         setB(const std::uint8_t value); ```
    - ``` void         setA(const std::uint8_t value); ```

### DirectionalLight (class)
  - This light is used for things such as the Sun as it just has a direction on which to affect objects.

### PointLight (class)
  - This light is used for when to want light a specific part of the scene in a circular shape.

### SpotLight (class)
  - This light is used for lighting a specific part of the scene in a cone shaped manner (by using an angle to decide the area of effect).

### Vertex (class)
  - This class is the Uber vertex class used for the drawing of any graphics on screen.

### Transform (class)
- Member Functions (You should have more functions than this for manipulating the transform)

  - A **DrawItem** contains all of the state except for Depth / Stencil and Render Targets.
```cpp

RenderMaterial* const material = engine.fileSystem().makeMaterial("CustomMaterial");
material->setValue("uTextureDiffuse",  std::make_pair<int, Texture2D*>(0, textureDiffuse));
material->setValue("uTextureSpecular", std::make_pair<int, Texture2D*>(1, textureSpecular));
material->setValue("uTextureNormal",   std::make_pair<int, Texture2D*>(2, textureNormal));
material->setBlend(BlendMode::ALPHA_BLENDING);
material->setShader(coolShader420);

  // NOTE: 'material' inherits whatever state 'default_material' defines.
RenderMaterial* const material_inheritance[] = {default_material, material};

DrawItem* const item = engine.renderer().makeDrawItem(material_inheritance, 2)
item->bindTransform(Mat4x4*);
item->bindBuffer(Buffer*);
item->draw(DrawMode, first_vertex, num_vertices);
item->drawIndexed(DrawMode, first_index, num_indices);
item->end();

  // ... later in the update loop ...
engine.graphics().enqueueDrawItem(item);

  // or alternative Immediate Mode / Command based API
engine.graphics().cmdBeginDrawItem(material_inheritance, 2);
engine.graphics().cmdPushTransform(Mat4x4*);
engine.graphics().cmdPushBuffer(Buffer*);
engine.graphics().cmdPushDraw(DrawMode, first_vertex, num_vertices);
engine.graphics().cmdPushDrawIndexed(DrawMode, first_index, num_indices);
engine.graphics().cmdEndDrawItem();

  // for when you want to draw the same thing but change something like the DrawMode
engine.graphics().cmdBeginClonedDrawItem(item);
engine.graphics().cmdPushDrawIndexed(DrawMode, first_index, num_indices);
engine.graphics().cmdEndDrawItem();

```

# Math
  - For (most of) the math module we are just going to use the [glm](#dependencies) library as that will lead to the most efficient workflow. No need to write our own math library this time around. If we find any performance issues then maybe we can SIMD optimize the operations but I believe [glm](#dependencies) already makes use of SSE intrinsics.

## Mat4x4 (typedef)
  - glm::mat4

## Vec4 (typedef)
  - glm::vec4

## Vec3 (typedef)
  - glm::vec3

## Vec2 (typedef)
  - glm::vec2

## Camera (class)
  - This class is for managing the current state of the camera on a per [Area][] basis.

# RANDOM NOTES NOT THAT USEFUL FOR NOW
- Each  draw  item  is  a  very  compact  structure,  containing  state  IDs.
- XOR’ing two  draw  items  creates  a  bitmask  that  highlights  any  changes.
- Masking  out  sections  of  that  bitmask  and  comparing  them  to  zero  lets  you  quickly  check  if  a  state  has  changed  since  the  previous  draw item.
## IDEA : Use Lua as a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for defining 'Techniques' rather than hardcoding them
- Use sorting Keys
- But if Alpha blended: ~*(u32*)distance as the sorting key
- Opaque can use a hybrid to do front to back. (mix original sort key and distance)

- Shaders
  - Shaders can indicate what slots it uses using a bit mask
    - EX ((1 << 0) | (1 << 2)) for using samplers 0 and 2

## Vulkan
- Vulkan's Memory Model
  - Has two aspects "visibility" and "availibility"
    - HOST_COHERENT / vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges is all about visibility
    - Availibility is from waiting on resources using primitives such as: Events, Fences, and Semaphores.
      - The device would use "vkPipelineBarrier"s rather than fences (which is generally for the host)
- USE HOST_COHERENT or "vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges"
- vkQueueSubmit automatically creates a memory barrier between (properly flushed) host writes issued before vkQueueSubmit and any usage of those writes from the command buffers in the submit command (and of course, commands in later submit operations).
- All you have to do for "vkMapMemory" since it doesn't tell you if the device is using the data is to use a fence (the fence from the submission).
  - Since when you submit is the only time the device is going to use that mapped memory.

## Buffer Usage Patterns

| Life Time  | Example              | Desc          |
|:---------- |:--------------------:|:-----------|
| "Forever"  | Level Geometry       |> Should be loaded from behind a load screen since this is so rare. > Make these immutable since we wont be updating these. > Use a staging buffer so these can this can use GPU device local storage.|
| Long Lived | Character Models     ||
| Transient  | UI, Text             ||
| Temporary  | Particles (Streamed) ||
| Constants  | Shader Uniforms      ||

- Long Lived
  - The average case so use the defaults for this.
  - Should probably use a staging buffer still.

- Temporary
  - Uses a dynamic buffer that is host visible.
  - Pretty much lives in RAM. (map and unmap)
  - OpenGL - DYNAMIC flag.
  - Constants
